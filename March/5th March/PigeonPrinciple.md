# Pigeon Principle / Pigeon 

If there are `N` cages/pigeon-hole  and `N + 1` pigeons and every cage/pigeon-hole has atleast one pigeon then there will exist a pigeon hole which has atleast two pigeons in it.

## Pigeon Sort

TC -> O(N + range)
range = max - min + 1

## Write a program in java to sort an array {8, 2, 2, 7, 1, 6, 8}
